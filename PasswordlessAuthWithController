On Servers:

sudo passwd ubuntu --> change the password of the user with whome you want passwordless authentication

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
search for PasswordAuthentication & put 'yes' instead of no
sudo service sshd restart

Now Change the python version to 2.7

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-pip

Do it for all the servers with whome you want passwordless connection
then use ssh ubuntu@172.31.44.90,it will connect without password
